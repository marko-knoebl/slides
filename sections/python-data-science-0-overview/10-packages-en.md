# Packages

## Python packages for data science

- _Jupyter_ and _IPython_: interactive Python environments
- _NumPy_: library for efficient processing of numerical data
- _Pandas_: library for data analysis, based on NumPy
- _Matplotlib_ and _Pyplot_: library for data visualization
- _Scikit-Learn_: library for machine learning, based on NumPy
- _Tensorflow_ / _Keras_: library for deep learning

## Compiled packages and Python versions

Compiled packages (like _NumPy_, _TensorFlow_ or _PyTables_) may take several months before they are available for the newest Python version.

recommendation: use an older Python version (e.g. 3.8 instead of 3.9) or a pre-built distribution (like Anaconda)

## Python packages for data science

installing the most important packages in an existing Python environment:
