# Hooks

## Hooks

Hooks = extension of function components

A _basic_ function component can render contents based on props and it can trigger events.

Hooks allow for advanced functionality, e.g. having internal component state or listening for lifecycle events.

## Hooks

Hooks are special functions that can be called at the start of a component definition.

Examples:

- `useState(...)`
- `useEffect(...)`
- `useContext(...)`
- `useReducer(...)`

## Rules of Hooks

Hooks inside a component definition must be called in the same order every time the component renders - React uses the call order to distinguish between e.g. multiple calls to `useState`

The same rules as in a component apply to hook calls inside a cutom hook
