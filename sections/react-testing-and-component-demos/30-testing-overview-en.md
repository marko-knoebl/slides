# Testing

## Automated testing in JavaScript

Some functions in React - including Reducers - are just plain JavaScript functions and can be tested like any other function.

See the presentation [JavaScript Testing](./javascript-testing-en.html) for an overview (note: the library Jest is already set up in a create-react-app project)
