# Control structures

## Control structures

By using control structures we can execute some code repeatedly or only under certain circumstances.

## Control structures

The two most essential control structures in every programming language are:

- if/else
- loops

## Control structures in Python

- `if`
- loops:
  - `while`
  - `for ... in ...`
  - `for ... in range(...)`
